* INFORMATION:
1. You are downloading a hack that was designed for Windows 7/Vista.
The reason this hack is for windows 7/Vista is because it uses functions of Windows AERO to use as a medium to draw the hack information on. Windows XP does not and will not have those functions on it (Sorry).

2. You download one .rar file - when extracted it makes a set of folders containing the released compiled version of the stock hack, and a folder with the source code for the hack itself.

3. Why this hack is safe vs. other hacks that are injected.
When you use a hack that injects its own code into a game, it changes information in the running game in your computers memory.
VAC2 is designed to scan for these changes and flag your account for hacking.
This hack uses RPM (Read Process Memory), and does not insert it's own code into the hack. It simply takes information about enemies, their location, etc, and does some math to calculate the information presented on the screen in the form of the hack. The actual information that is show on the screen is not
drawn on the game window itself, (as that would be easily detected), but rather drawn using functions of Windows Aero theme, on and invisible overlay that sits on top of your game. This is why the game needs to be in windowed mode, in order to allow the overlay to sit on top.

Be careful however, VAC finally started using EXE signature scanning and the MW2 hack was finally detected after 9 months...

 INSTRUCTIONS: Using stand-alone executable.

1. Download the file as attachment on the first post of this page

2. If you do not have winrar installed, download it at, [url=http://www.rarlab.com/]WinRAR archiver, a powerful tool to process RAR and ZIP files[/url],
After you know you have winrar installed extract the .rar file to a location, say your desktop for example.
Inside the folder you have this directory structure.
Look inside the folder and you have 'launcher.exe', this is the hack you will use. (Feel free to move this folder anywhere as long as you keep all the files together.)

Note: there is a 'library.zip' containing the actual code in pre-compiled Python bytecode. This zip file may be marked as corrupt by winrar but it's not! (It's actually a .z file).

*** DO NOT RENAME OR UNZIP THE 'library.zip' FILE ! ***
*** DO NOT INJECT ANY DLL ***

 INSTRUCTIONS: Using the source.

Unpack the rar file as above.
