- STAND ALONE VERSION
=====================

The rar contains a full stand-alone version in the "dist" folder. You can move the folder anywhere on your disk, even on a USB memory. Just keep all files together (launcher.exe, config, library.zip, python26.dll).

Note: "library.zip" may be reported as a corrupt ZIP file by WinRAR and others, but it's not. It is actually a "z" file and not a "zip" file. Do not rename it or change its extension.

- HOWTO (NOT) COMPILE
=====================
This program is written in Python (http://python.org/) which is a interpreted scripting language. It does not require any compilation process compared to the previous C++ version.

All files are automatically compiled into byte-code files (*.pyc) at runtime.

You may wonder: why Python, and isn't an scripting language too slow?
Python makes customizing and updating the app far easier and more fun than C++. I hate C++.
Concerning performance, it is true that Python is by far slower than C++. But the CPU usage of this hack is very low and the major part is being consumed in native DirectX calls. There is negligible impact on CPU.

Note: I am using Psyco, a Just-In-Time bytecode compiler which gives a x2 performance boost. (http://psyco.sourceforge.net/)

To use the source-file version you need to install ActivePython v2.6.xxx (freeware)

Download link: http://downloads.activestate.com/ActivePython/releases/2.6.5.12/ActivePython-2.6.5.12-win32-x86.msi

To run the app:
  - double-click on "launcher.py"
  - or type "python lancher.py" in command-line, and make sure the current folder is the "src" folder

I recommend to use an IDE. I use Eclipse + PyDev extension. It is heavy-weight (+250MB) but very powerful.

You might consider PyScripter as  a light-weight alternative.

- HOWTO BUILD THE STAND-ALONE VERSION
=====================================

- Open command-line
- clear the "dist" folder
- change the working dir to "src"
- launch "python setup.py py2exe"
- it will create the "dist" folder containing all required files
- you can safely remove the "build" folder
